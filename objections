What reaction I have to do on these objections:
1. not interested e.g. "I'm not interested in any insurance" "not really interested" "not really interested talking about insurance" "I'm not interested in anything you're selling"
2. don't call me e.g. "put me on your Do Not Call list"
3. Don't speak English "speaking Spanish speaking Spanish"
не реальный возраст - надо переспрашивать
